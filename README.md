# Gladier / Globus Interface for CLI Development üõ†Ô∏è

This repository provides a simple Gladier/Globus script for generating Workflow Execution Plans (WEPs) for testing and integrating the LivePublication CLI/SDK. The current focus of CLI/SDK development is on embedding prospective entities within the [Provenance Run Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/provenance_run_crate) during the initialization of a Gladier-Globus flow.

A discussion on the alignment of Provenance crates, the Gladier-Globus context, and LivePublication can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yhmhgvkhstyh#08d871).
